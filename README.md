## Challenges and Solution
One of the challenges I faced the number in the y-axis was not even spaced
The solution was to have each number evenly spaced by using a scale

Last challenge that I faced was initially the program was written in class and this was making the program very lengthy and hard to debug
The solution was to create sperate classes and have all related functionalities there

I have learned that using loops, arrays, functions, and conditional statements can create a relatively large software project design
